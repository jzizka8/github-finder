# Github finder
This is a test project, it contains user input. Upon writing the username, it will display info about the user, their repositories and organizations.
## Used tools
I used Material UI for most components and Tailwind for layout and additional styling.
## TODO
Find a viable eslint/prettier preset and format accordingly, to avoid inconsistencies.
